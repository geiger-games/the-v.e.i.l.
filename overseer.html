<h3>Hi...</h3>
<p>Alright, let's get straight to the point. I'm just the overseer of this organisation, and I made this website. <i>sigh</i> You're welcome, I guess.</p>
<p>Have I set up an ethics team? Yep... after a million and fifty asks, I did it. It's led by uh... <i>leader of ethics team whispers to me</i> oh, can't say. My bad.</p>
<p>Ethics team: <button onclick="load('ethics-team')">here.</button></p>
<p>Back to me, since this is my personal document. Alrighty!, just got another cuppa joe.</p>
<p>If you wanna propose literally <b>any</b> anomaly to me as a discovery, then please don't- No, no, juuust kidding.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have seen my best researcher and friend...</p>
<p>...wrote down "gun" in a1-a and <red><b>[...I have no words for this...]</b></red> during some random checkup. This definitely could've been prevented, I wanted to, it's like... he never came to me, you know?</p>
<blockquote>Note: everybody has been helping me out since then. I love my colleagues, they're like family. The family that I lost.</blockquote>
<p>Very sad note to end on, but we saw a2 grow leaves with the veins looking like a happy face, so at least that.</p>
