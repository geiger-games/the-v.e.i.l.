<h1>Safety and Containment Ratings</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Blue</strong> → basically harmless / just put it in a cell</li>
  <li><strong>Green</strong> → minor risk / might “complain” a bit</li>
  <li><strong>Yellow</strong> → injuries possible / aggressive</li>
  <li><strong>Red</strong> → lethal / actively trying to escape</li>
  <li><strong>Purple</strong> → catastrophic / mass destruction potential</li>
  <li><strong>Grey</strong> → situational, depends on context</li>
</ul>

<h1>Identification</h1>
<p>Basically, just how to search stuff.</p>
<p>Anomalies are added in order, and you can find them by searching "a" and the number. That is your Anomaly ID (ex. a1, a349).</p>
<p>Tests about anomalies are found by searching "t" and the number. That gives you a fresh Test Log of an anomaly (ex. t1, t210).</p>
<p>Researchers are just found with their name (warning: first letter must be uppercase!)</p>
