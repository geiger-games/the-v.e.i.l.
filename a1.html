  "yeah uh we found this pen without a holder writing shit like 'new computer' and everything that it wrote just clumped up in this insane pile of foam letters and objects. i honestly, have no words."

<p>The Never-Ending Pen is a pen that never needs ink replenishment, never needs a holder, and never stops writing.</p>
<p>Note: Never put this pen together in the same container as a1-a. If together, they will amplify and create a field of reality at over 10 thousand Humes. Safe to say that you would be instantly charred to death.</p>
